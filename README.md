# codeblitz2: Plot-based forest metrics in R

## Background 

This is a team exercise designed to help us get more comfortable with 
**collaborative coding in R** and **using GitHub** for ecological problem-solving.  

This Code Blitz helps us build reusable tools and skills that will ultimately 
allow us to process LiDAR and forest monitoring data efficiently. The code here
will  build toward a lab project where we use **aerial LiDAR data** to provide
detailed assessments of **basal area, density, and tree size** across all of 
the property for multiple years. This will be  valuable contribution to research
and conservation departments.

To train advanced models, we‚Äôll need strong training data ‚Äî and the Jones
Center‚Äôs long-term forest monitoring program gives us a great foundation.  

## üéØ Products and Goals

By the end of this Code Blitz, we will

* Learning goals
  - Learn how to **write functions in R**  
  - Practice **basic forest structure equations** (BA, density, QMD, canopy cover)  
  - Build teamwork skills in **collaborative coding with GitHub**  
  - More hands-on experience with GitHub branching, merging, and collaborative coding
* Research products
  - A set of reusable R functions for forest metrics
  - Summary graphs of key forest structure metrics
  - Training data for site-wide structural assessments

## Ichauway Long-term forest monitoring plots (LTM)

At each plot, field crews:  
- Measure all trees >10 cm DBH within a fixed-radius plot (radius = 18m, area = 0.10ha/0.25 ac).  
- Tag and identify trees to species (using internal species codes).  
- Map all trees using distance and azimuth (which we can convert to XY coordinates).

Schematic of a single LTM plot. All of the data we are working with come 
from the 18 m diameter **Subplot 1**

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started / Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have:  

- **R** and **RStudio** installed  
- Access to the **Jones Center R: drive** (for main datasets)  At least one
person per team

- A GitHub account  
- üí° See [codeblitz1](https://github.com/landeco-jonesctr/codeblitz1/) if you 
need a refresher on this.

### Required R Packages
We‚Äôll use the following packages during this exercise:  

```r
install.packages("tidyverse") #contains dplyr, ggplot2, readr, etc.
```
---

## Getting Back on GitHub
1. ‚úÖ Make sure someone on your team has **direct R drive access**  
2. ‚úÖ In **RStudio**:  
   - Go to **File > New Project > Version Control**  
   - Select **Git**, then paste in this repo link:  
     ```
     https://github.com/landeco-jonesctr/codeblitz2
     ```
   - Choose a local folder to store the repo  
3. ‚úÖ Create your own **team branch** (pick one person to lead this)  
4. ‚úÖ Create a new `team.R` file to write and submit your code
4. ‚úÖ Work with your team to complete your assigned task  
5. ‚úÖ Save, commit, and push your changes to GitHub  
6. ‚úÖ Submit a pull request, so we can merge your updates.
6. ‚úÖ Select someone to present your code to the group

## ‚öôÔ∏è Group Work 1: Functions (20‚Äì30 min)

You‚Äôll be divided into **4 groups**, each tackling a coding task:  

Data for the exercise can be found here:

`'R:/landscape_ecology/codeblitz/codeblitz2/ltm-data.csv'`

### Group 1: Species Lookup
- Write an R function to convert **species codes ‚Üí full names**  
- Input: vector of species codes  
- Output: species names  
- Add error checking (e.g., bad inputs)  
- Make it **case insensitive** (bonus)  

### Group 2: Basal Area
- Write an R function to calculate **basal area (m¬≤/ha)**  
- Make sure units are correct (dbh in cm)  
- Handle missing values (`NA`)  

### Group 3: Quadratic Mean Diameter (QMD)
- Write an R function to calculate **QMD at the plot level**  

### Group 4: Canopy Cover
- Write an R function to summarize **canopy cover** at the plot level  
- Use densiometer measurements (usually an average of 4 readings per plot)  

### Dataset Output Guidance

**Preferred format:** Shapefile (for spatial outputs) or CSV (simpler summary tables).

Each team should include the following columns:

`Plot | Year | BA | Density | QMD | UTMX | UTMY`

**Naming conventions:** Shapefile: `Ichuway_BA.shp`, `Ichuway_Density.shp`, `Ichuaway_QMD.shp`

### ü©∫ Anatomy of an R Function

Here‚Äôs a quick template you can adapt:  

```r
# Anatomy of a function in R
my_function <- function(input1, input2 = default_value) {
  # Do something with the inputs
  result <- mean(input1, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  return(result)
}

# Example: a simple average function using sum() and length()
average <- function(x) {
  if (!is.numeric(x)) stop("Input must be numeric!")
  x <- x[!is.na(x)]        # remove NAs
  if (length(x) == 0) return(NA)  # return NA if all inputs missing
  return(sum(x) / length(x))
}
```

### Function names and info, examples
```
# Species lookup
lookup_species <- function(codes) {
  # input: character vector of codes
  # output: character vector of species names
}

# Basal area
calc_ba <- function(dbh_cm) {
  # input: numeric vector of DBH in cm
  # output: numeric basal area in m^2/ha
}

# QMD
calc_qmd <- function(dbh_cm) {
  # input: numeric vector of DBH per plot
  # output: numeric QMD in cm
}

}
```

| Function | Input | Output | Notes / Error Handling |
|----------|-------|--------|----------------------|
| **Species Lookup** | Vector of species codes (character) | Vector of full species names (character) | Should handle unknown codes (`NA`) and ignore case |
| **Basal Area (BA)** | Vector of DBH (cm) | Numeric basal area in m¬≤/ha | Remove NAs; DBH must be numeric |
| **Quadratic Mean Diameter (QMD)** | Vector of DBH (cm) per plot | Numeric QMD (cm) | Remove NAs; return NA if no trees |
| **Canopy Cover** | Vector of densiometer readings per plot | Numeric canopy cover (%) | Usually average of 4 readings; remove NAs |

## üìä Group Work 2: Main Dataset (20 min)

Now, let‚Äôs apply what you built to the main dataset (on the R drive).

‚ö†Ô∏è These data are not public, so make sure someone on your team has R drive access.

### Teams & Tasks:

* Team Root: Calculate total BA for all plots by year
* Team Shoot: Calculate density for all plots by year
* Team Bark: Calculate QMD for all plots by year
* For all teams:
  - Make a graph of your average statistic by year
  - Make another graph of your statistic by year for the 5 major species
  - (Bonus) Add standard error bars

Hint, for summarizing data use the `tidyverse` package which contains
the function `group_by` and `summarize`

```
# choose the dataset and the groups you want to summarize by
mydata = group_by(mydata, Plot, Year)

# summarize the output using statistics like mean, median, or sd
output = summarize(mydata, )

# You can chain them using the pipe operator %>%
output %>% group_by(Plot, Year) %>% 
  summarize(ba_mean = mean(basal_area), ba_sd = sd(basal_area))
```

### GitHub Workflow for Group Work 2

* ‚úÖ Switch back to the main branch
* ‚úÖ Pull to update your local copy
* ‚úÖ Switch back to your team branch

Team: Leah, Khanh, Tanner, Carly, Tristen

Compile everyone‚Äôs outputs into one shapefile or table:

| Plot | Year | BA | Density | QMD | UTMX | UTMY |
|:----:|:----:|:--:|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1    | 2020 | x  | x       | x   | x   | y   |

| 2    | 2022 | x  | x       | x   | x   | y   |


Each row = plot √ó year summary of:

* Live basal area
* Tree density
* Quadratic mean diameter
